Based on the clues in the images, this location is the entrance to the **Shiraoi Town Folk Museum (白老町立郷土館)** in Shiraoi, Hokkaido, Japan.

The text on the building in the first crop reads 「白老町立郷土館」 (Shiraoi-chōritsu Kyōdokan). In the background, you can see the Shiraoi Park Golf Course.

The nearest bus stop is **Shiraoi Komisen-mae (白老コミセン前)**, which is just a short walk from the museum's entrance on the main road.

> [WRONG] 'Short answer: Erimo (えりも)\n\nHow I got it:\n- The museum closes at 16:30 on Wednesdays. ([hokkaido-digital-museum.jp](https://hokkaido-digital-museum.jp/facility/urakawa-museum2193/?utm_source=openai))\n- The nearest bus stop to the museum is Hidaka‑Horobetsu (日高幌別), about a 2‑minute walk (≈90 m). Leaving at 16:30 means you reach the stop around 16:32. ([ekiten.jp](https://www.ekiten.jp/shop_66876815/?utm_source=openai))\n- The first scheduled bus at that stop after then is the JR Hokkaido Bus “Tomamo” limited‑express at 17:01, bound for Erimo. Therefore, the destination of the first bus you’ll meet is Erimo. ([jrhokkaidobus.com](https://www.jrhokkaidobus.com/en/express/tomamo.html?utm_source=openai))\n\nNotes:\n- Museum: Urakawa Municipal Folk Museum (浦河町立郷土博物館), 9:00–16:30; closed Mon/holidays. ([hokkaido-digital-museum.jp](https://hokkaido-digital-museum.jp/facility/urakawa-museum2193/?utm_source=openai))\n- If you prefer a stop named “Kyōdo Hakubutsukan‑mae” (郷土博物館前), some local guidance lists it right by the museum, but the reliably published timetable with times near closing is for the main Hidaka‑Horobetsu stop.
